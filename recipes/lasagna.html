  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base.
     Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly!
     This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.
</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
    <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)
</li>
    <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)
</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced
</li>
    <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce
</li>
    <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)
</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Put pasta water on to boil
Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on
the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come
to a boil (this will be your pasta water),
so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat.
       Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon
of fat.</li>
    <li>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the photo we are
      using yellow bell pepper and red onions).
Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened.
 Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to
low and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes,
      tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.</li>
    <li>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.)

Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.

When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.</li>
    <li>Heat the oven to 375Â°F</li>
    <li>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, edge may overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.

Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple inches. Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top of ricotta cheese.

Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining Mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan.

Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining Mozzarella cheese.</li>
  </ol>
