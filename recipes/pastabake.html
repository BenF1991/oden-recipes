  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Cheesy Pasta Bake With Chicken And Bacon is one of those dinners
    that the kids can polish off in no time - regardless of how many
    veggies I sneak in there. Peppers, onions, tomatoes, spinach
    - it all gets thrown in.
</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>400 g dried pasta</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3 large chicke breasts</li>
    <li>1 large onion</li>
    <li>1 red pepper</li>
    <li>1 yellow bell pepper</li>
    <li>pinch of salt</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 190c/375f. Boil a large pan of
      water and cook the pasta for 1 minute less than
      recommended on the pack. Drain.</li>
    <li>Whilst the pasta is cooking, heat the oil on a medium heat, in a large
       frying pan. Add the chicken, and cook until
       just sealed - about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the onion and cook for a further 3-4 minutes until the onion
       is softened.</li>
    <li>Add the chopped peppers, salt, pepper, garlic, tomato puree,
      oregano and thyme. Stir and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in the tinned tomatoes and cream, bring to a gentle bubble, then add the pasta, spinach and cooked bacon.
      Stir everything together, then transfer to a large baking dish.</li>
    <li>Top with the cheddar and mozzarella, and place in the oven for 20-25
      minutes, until the cheese is golden brown.</li>
    <li>Take out of the oven and top with parsley before serving.</li>
  </ol>
